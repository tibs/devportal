Create alerts with OpenSearch® Dashboards
=========================================

OpenSearch® alerting feature sends notifications when data from one or more indices meets certain conditions that can be customized.
Use case examples are such as monitoring for HTTP status code 503, CPU load average above certain percentage or watch for counts of a specific keyword in logs for a specific amount of interval,
notification to be configured to be sent via email, slack or custom webhooks and other destination.

In the following example we are using Slack as the destination and a ``sample-host-health`` index as datasource to create a simple alert to check cpu load. An action will be triggered when average of ``cpu_usage_percentage`` over ``3`` minutes is above ``75%``.

Create using Dashboards UI
**************************

In order to create an alert via OpenSearch Dashboards interface, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the `Aiven web console <https://console.aiven.io>`_ and select your OpenSearch service.

2. Click the **Overview** tab and under `Connection Information` click on **OpenSearch Dashboards** tab.

   This opens the OpenSearch Dashboard

3. In OpenSearch Dashboard open the left side panel and under `OpenSearch Plugins` click on **Alerting**.


To configure each alert the following needs to be created, we will walk-through configuration of each section.

- ``Destination``
- ``Monitor``
- ``Data source``
- ``Query``
- ``Trigger``

Create a destination
********************
Destination is a location for notifications to be delivered when an action is triggered.

1. Open the **Destination** tab and click on **Add destination**
   
2. Fill in the fields under **Destination**

   Fill ``slack-test`` as the **Name**
   
   Select ``Slack`` under **Type**
   
   Paste your slack webhook here ``https://your_slack_webhook_URL`` under **Webhook URL**

.. note::
   Destination Type can be: ``Amazon Chime``, ``Slack``, ``Custom webhook`` or ``Email``

.. important::
   - When using email you need to have a SMTP server configured for a valid domain to deliver email notifications

Email destination with authenticated sender
*******************************************
This procedure needs to be taken whenever you need to authenticate the sender's account before sending email messages. To do so, the credentials need to be added first to the OpenSearch keystore. Thus, this is going to be the very first preparatory step that needs to be done in the Aiven console.

1. In **Overview** tab of your OpenSearch service, **Advanced Config** section, fill in the following fields and save:

   - ``email_sender_name``
   - ``email_sender_username``
   - ``email_sender_password``

   At the end of this step the email account creedentials will be added to the OpenSearch keystore. That is, the steps-by-step procedure that follows need to be completed in OpenSearch Dashboards.

2. Open the **Destination** tab and click on **Add destination**

3. Fill in the fields under **Destination**

   Fill ``email-test`` as the **Name**

   Select ``Email`` under **Type**

   In this step we assume that no senders exist yet. So, click first on **Manage Senders**, then click on **New sender** link.

   Assign a name to the sender. Please note that this name should match the property ``opensearch.email_sender_name`` from step 1.

   Fill in the information required by the form and select SSL or TLS in **Encryption method**.

4. Lastly you need to complete the form with the recipients, by creating email groups in **Manage email groups** if necessary.

Create a monitor
****************
Monitor is a job that runs on a defined schedule and queries OpenSearch indices. 

1. Open the **Monitors** tab and click on **Create monitor**

2. Fill in the fields under **Monitor details**
   
   Fill ``High CPU Monitor`` into **Monitor name**

   Select ``Per query monitor`` as the **Monitor type** 
   
   Select ``Visual editor`` as the **Monitor defining method** 

   Select ``By interval`` under **Schedule** **Frequency**

   Under **Run every** select ``1`` ``Minutes``

.. note::
   Schedule Frequency can be `By internal`, `Daily`, `Weekly`, `Monthly`, `Custom CRON expression`

1. Fill in the fields under **Data source** 
   
   Data source is the OpenSearch indices to query.
 
   Fill ``sample-host-health`` into **index**

   Fill ``timestamp`` into **Time field**

2. **Query**

   Query defines the fields to query from indices and how to evaluate the results.

   Under **Metrics** click on **Add metric** 

   Select ``average()`` under **Aggregation** and ``cpu_usage_percentage`` under **Field**, click on **Save**

   Fill ``3`` under **Time range for the last** and select ``minutes``

Create a trigger
****************
Triggers is a defined conditions from the queries results from monitor.  If conditions are met, alerts are generated.

1. Click on **Add trigger**

   Fill ``high_cpu`` as the **Trigger name**

   Select ``1 (Highest)`` for **Severity level**

   Under **Trigger condition** select ``IS ABOVE`` from the drop-down menu and fill ``75`` into the number field

.. note::
   You can see a visual graph below trigger with the index data and the trigger condition you have defined as a red line

2. Fill in the fields under **Actions**

   Actions defines the destination for notification alerts when trigger conditions are met.
     
   Fill in ``slack`` as **Action name**

   Select ``slack-test`` under **Destination**

   Fill in ``High CPU Test Alert`` as **Message subject**

.. note::
   Multiple Actions can be defined, in this example we will define one action to send notification to destination we have defined in step 4

Alert message
*************

**Message** can be adjusted as needed, check **Message Preview** to see the sample and use **Send test message** to validate notification delivery

Click on **Create** and your monitor is ready!
